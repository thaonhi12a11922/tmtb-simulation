# TMT-B Simulation

<h2> Project Overview</h1>

The Trail Making Test (TMT) is widely used in psychological assessments to evaluate cognitive abilities, particularly attention, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. The TMT-B variant specifically measures the subject's ability to rapidly switch attention between different stimuli and connect them in an ascending order of numbers and letters.

This application is created with an attempt to simulate the TMT-B to measure the level of human alternating attention in a research regarding to the influence of napping on human academic performance. It is aimed at providing a digital tool for researchers to administer the test and gather data efficiently.
