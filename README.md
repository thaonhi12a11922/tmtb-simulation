# TMT-B Simulation

<h2> Project Overview</h1>
TMT-B Simulation is a specialized test designed to measure the level of human alternating attention. This project was created as part of my first research project, which focused on studying the influence of napping on human academic performance. The TMT-B Simulation application was developed individually within a tight deadline of 7 days to simulate the TMT-B test.

The Trail Making Test (TMT) is widely used in psychological assessments to evaluate cognitive abilities, particularly attention, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. The TMT-B variant specifically measures the subject's ability to rapidly switch attention between different stimuli and connect them in an ascending order of numbers and letters.

By creating this TMT-B Simulation, I aimed to provide a digital tool that researchers and practitioners can use to administer the test and gather data efficiently. This simulation closely resembles the original test and offers a standardized platform for conducting experiments related to human attention and performance.
